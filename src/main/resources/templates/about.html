        <h1>Obligatory Backstory</h1>
      </div>
      <p>You are a minion. Your leader has perished, leaving no viable heir to his dictatorship.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Up to now your life has been pretty uneventful. You toil for minimum pay, live in a hovel, and watch an absurd amount of reality TV shows. Your happiness ranking is moderately high, but your thirst-for-power and appetite-for-destruction rankings are in the proverbial toilet.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>You have few aspirations, much less political aspirations. Without a maniacal dictator controlling your every move, your life feels even more aimless than usual. You discuss your thoughts and feelings with your peers, who grudgingly reveal that they've been holding secret meetings behind your back. They have come to an agreement in which they will create their own dictatorships and then vote amongst themselves to decide who is most or least likely to lead the country to its ultimate demise.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>The only problem is that most of your fellow minions are idiots.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>You have a pretty big, head-hurting decision to make. Will you decide to continue being a minion, and support the potential dictatorships that you believe hold the most potential to better your life and your TV viewing options? Will you revolt against those who are most likely to lead your country to ruin? If you remain a minion, your only choice is to support or revolt against the proposed dictatorships of your fellow minions.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Or you could put a tiny fraction of effort into creating your very own dictatorship. How else will you know how much people hate you and your terrible ideas? You could easily create a dictatorship of your own that would delay your country's imminent destruction by weeks, if not months. Your moderately terrible ideas and beliefs should be judged and widely derided alongside everyone else's, you decide in a moment of stupefying clarity. Just make sure to put an appropriate amount of thought into your ideas, as poor creation attempts will be on public display and mocked mercilessly on Twitter.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Like a real dictatorship, others are free to support or rise against you as they see fit, with little to no consequences for their actions. You can try to create a dictatorship that has the highest number of loyal followers, or one that everyone wants to see burn to the ground. Whatever you want to do is fine; we're not here to judge you to your face.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Bolstered by your weak ambitions and pitiful ideologies, your proposed dictatorship could quickly fall into chaos and despair. Will you attempt to rule your fellow ingrates with an iron fist, or take a softer approach and strive for peace? Will you work to charm your so-called peers and make grand gestures of compromise, or will you threaten and manipulate your way to ultimate power? Either way, it should make for great ratings.</p>
